;
;   load = A4284

;       0: Disable floatpin LPT command and report an error when used.

;
;   The floatpintype entry can be used to change the floatpin implementation
;   for 60211-Preamps with hardware revision Cx or later and floating firmware
;   revision of c02 and later.
;   Valid entries are:
;       2: Original implementation.
;       9: New implementation.  Modified to improve performance.
;       No floatpintype entry: Original implementation.
;   Note: Hardware revision Cx with floating firmware revision of c01 will
;   generate an error at boot time if the new implementation (9) is set.
