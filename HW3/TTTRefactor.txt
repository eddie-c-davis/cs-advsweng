TicTacToe Refactoring

 1) The TTTGraphics2P construcor is too long (more than a page.
    * Break it up by adding an 'addMouseListener' method.
    * CodeComplete Reason: A routine is too long

 2) The DrawCanvas class is poorly named (it is a verb), renamed to DrawingCanvas.

 3) The 'hasWon' method is poorly named, it should be 'isWon' to match 'isDraw' method.

 4) The DrawingCanvas.paintComponent method is too comparmentalized, splitting its responsibilities into drawGridLines,
    drawSeeds, and updateStatusBar methods.

 5) The code in the 'drawSeeds' and 'updateStatusBar' methods rely on 'if' statements to determine code to execute
    based on the type of an enumeration (e.g., Seed, GameState). This means that any time a new type needs to be
    added (assume a three player version of TTT is created with 'Star' shape), all of the code needs to be modified,
    violating the OCP. Instead, Seed and GameState should be converted into classes and the behavior differentation
    can be handled via polymorphism rather than if or case statements.
  
  6) Decompose a boolean expression.
    * The isWon method uses a complex boolean expression. This should be decomposed into a set of boolean methods.
    * They are also hardcoded, assuming the grid size will always be 3X3. These should be loops instead.
