\section*{HW3: SOLID and Refactoring}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Covariant Argument Type}
	
	This code violates the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) because an
	instance of the base class \texttt{CatShelter} cannot reliably be
	substituted for an instance of \texttt{AnimalShelter}. Assume,
	for example, that some client code contained a reference to an \texttt{AnimalShelter} object, and that it was replaced with an instance of
	\texttt{CatShelter}. If the client attempted to invoke the \texttt{putAnimal}
	method with an instance of another \texttt{Animal} subclass, e.g.,
    \texttt{Dog}, this would produce a runtime error as the \texttt{CatShelter}
    class has overriden the \texttt{putAnimal} method with argument type
    \texttt{Cat}, and no method signature \texttt{putAnimal(Dog dog)} exists.
	
	In subcontracting terms, this is a problem because the \texttt{Cat} type
	in the \texttt{putAnimal} method imposes a stricter precondition,
	but overriden methods in subclasses should have weaker preconditions,
	otherwise the subcontract between the client and supplier is violated.
	
	The \texttt{Cat} return type of the overriden \texttt{getAnimal()} method
	is not a violation of the LSP because if the client with its
	\texttt{AnimalShelter} object invokes that method and assigns it 
	to an object of type \texttt{Animal}, a \texttt{Cat} object is-a \texttt{Animal} and should behave like one.
	
	\item \textbf{Open-Closed Principle}
	
	The \texttt{AreaCalculator.Area(Shape[] shapes)} method violates the 
	Open-Closed Principle (OCP) because the code within the \texttt{for}
	loop explicitly references the specific subclasses of the \texttt{Shape}
	class, \texttt{Rectangle} and \texttt{Circle}. This means that in order
	to add another type of shape, e.g., \texttt{Triangle}, requires the
	\texttt{Area} method to be modified. Thus, the class is \textit{not}
	closed for modification.
	
	The code could be improved by adding an \texttt{Area} method to the
	\texttt{Shape} abstract class, which is then implemented by each of the
	subclasses. Then the \texttt{AreaCalculator.Area} method only needs to
	call the \texttt{Area} method of each \texttt{Shape} object. Please see
	the following code for example.
	
	\begin{verbatim}
public abstract class Shape {
    public double Area();
}
    
public class Rectangle extends Shape {
    public double Area() {
        return rectangle.Width * rectangle.Height;
    }
}
    
public class Circle extends Shape {
    public double Area() {
        return circle.Radius * circle.Radius * Math.PI;
    }
}
    
public class Triangle extends Shape {
    public double Area() {
        return 0.5 * rectangle.Width * rectangle.Height;
    }
}

public class AreaCalculator {
    public double Area(Shape[] shapes) {
        double area = 0.0;
        for (Shape shape: shapes) {
            area += shape.Area();
        }
        return area;
     }
}
	\end{verbatim}

	\item \textbf{Refactoring}
