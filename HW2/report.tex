\section*{HW2: Design Principles}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Queue ADT specification with new, add, poll, peek, and isEmpty functions
	where $x$ is of generic type $G$ and $q$ is a queue of type $QUEUE[G]$.
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Type: \textit{QUEUE[G]}, all queues of arbitrary type $G$.
		\item Functions:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \texttt{new}: $\rightarrow QUEUE[G]$ \\
			$creator$ function
			\item \texttt{add}: $QUEUE[G] \times G \rightarrow QUEUE[G]$ \\
			$command$ function
			\item \texttt{poll}: $QUEUE[G] \rightarrowtail G$ \\
			$command$ function			
			\item \texttt{peek}: $QUEUE[G] \rightarrowtail G$ \\
    		$query$ function
			\item \texttt{isEmpty}: $QUEUE[G] \rightarrow BOOLEAN$ \\
    		$query$ function			
		\end{itemize}
		
		\item Axioms		
		$\forall x:G, q:QUEUE[G]$,
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item \texttt{poll}(\texttt{add}(\texttt{new}, $x$)) = $x$
				\item \texttt{peek}($q, x$) = \texttt{poll}($q, x$)
				\item \texttt{isEmpty}(\texttt{new}) = \texttt{true}
				\item \texttt{not isEmpty}(\texttt{add}($q, x$)) = \texttt{true}
        	\end{enumerate}		

		\item Preconditions		
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \texttt{poll}($q: QUEUE[G]$) \texttt{requires not isEmpty}($q$)
            \item \texttt{peek}($q: QUEUE[G]$) \texttt{requires not isEmpty}($q$)
		\end{itemize}
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Class Design (20 points. 10 points for each).
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item 
		The \texttt{ATM} class mixes business logic and networking. By implementing the \texttt{Runnable} interface, it is also mixes threading logic. Otherwise, 
		it provides a good abstraction, it is a noun with method names corresponding
		to the proper verbs describing its functionality, e.g., \texttt{switchOn},
		\texttt{switchOff}, \texttt{performStartup}, and \texttt{performShutdown}. \\
		
		The \texttt{Money} class is also a good abstraction, however one does question
		whether it is necessary. Most of its methods involve mathematical
    	(\texttt{add}, \texttt{subtract}) or comparative (\texttt{lessEqual})
    	functions that could be supported by a standard library class such as \texttt{Long}. Only the \texttt{toString} method is money specific,
    	and could be supported by the \texttt{Locale} class. \\
    	
    	Similarly, the \texttt{Card} class could easily be replaced by an
    	integer primitive \texttt{int}. However, if other properties or methods
    	needed to be added, it would be a reasonable abstraction.
		
		\item Consider the following variables in class SimulatedBank and related operations: ACCOUNT\_NUMBER, WITHDRAWALS\_TODAY, DAILY\_WINTHDRAWAL\_LIMIT, and BALANCE[]. How can you improve the design?
	\end{enumerate}

	\item Command-Query Separation Principle (10 points).
	
	\item Design by Contract  (20 points. 10 points for each).
	
	\item Class Invariant  (20 points. 10 points for each).
	
    \item Inheritance (10 points).

\end{enumerate}
