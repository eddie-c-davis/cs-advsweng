%% SuMMARY OF PAIR-PROGRAMING

\section{Summary of pair development}
The team had problems to meet due to schedule differences. There was a meeting every week on Fridays afternoon but that was the only time the full team could meet. To perform pair development of this project, the team could not perform a full pair development as defined by the project requirements. Due to this problem the team used Fridays meetings to work on some team development at the same time they were discussing the next milestones of the project.

Along the week and before the meetings, the team was in constant contact via Slack. This helped the team to be organized and perform some pair programming. Conceptual problems, bugs or meetings' misunderstandings were solved using this platform. The team considered this interaction as a pair programming development but did not track the tasks or the hours.

In the last meeting before the deadline, there were some bugs that had to be solved. The team was entirely pair working for the entire meeting to solve those bugs and have the product ready for the demo presentation. This pair programming last for 2 hours which almost satisfied the project requirements of each team member's pair programing hours.
