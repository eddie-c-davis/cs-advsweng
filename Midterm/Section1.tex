%% TEAM ORGANIZATION AND BUDDY RATING (1-2 PAGES)

\section{Team organization and buddy rating}

The team was organized under the Scrum framework. The roles were designated as follows.

\begin{itemize}
\item Product owner: \textit{Shared}
\item Scrum master: \textit{Shared}
\item Development team: \textit{Everyone}
\end{itemize}

The project was divided into three primary components:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Core Petri Net Modeling (Business Logic): Anil
\item Graphical User Interface (GUI): Iker
\item XML Input and Output Handling (I/O): Eddie
\end{enumerate}

Each member of the development time was primarily responsible for one of the three components, and the writing of the corresponding unit tests. However,
whenever one team member was too busy, another would step in to help with the
development of a key area. In general, level of collaboration between team
members was quite high, and no member in particular emerged as a leader of the
overall project.
